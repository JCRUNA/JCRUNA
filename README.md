- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JCRUNA
- ðŸ‘€ I am passionate about data, technology and innovation, focusing on artificial intelligence and app programming.

  Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, I focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  My pillars for the continuous development within these areas are:
    - Courses taken on the Coursera platform by **Andrew Ng and Laurence Moroney**
    - Short Courses taken on the DeepLearningAI platform about prompt-engineering , RAG,fine tuning and LLM Application Development.
    - Data science projects applied to the company I work for. 
    - Data Science Path on Datacamp.
    - *"Deep Learning with Python"* by **FranÃ§ois Chollet**.
    - *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition"* by **AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron**.
  I highly recommend reading these two books as they clearly explain the concepts and provide you with a series of tools that allow you to apply them in both work and personal environments.
  In one of my repositories I show examples from both books as well as my own application projects.
